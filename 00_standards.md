# Using NYS K-12 Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards to connect with lessons

## Grade 3 - Social Studies
## Standard: 2-3.NSD.4 
###### Recognize that information can be communicated using different representations that satisfy different rules.

Our school uses cross curricular instruction to incoporate CS and digital fluency throughout the day.  It has become a bigger push during the pandemic as students and teachers interact with each other remotely.  For our social studies project, our students have been provided google slides templates to provide information on a person or place of the country we have been studying.  Students are asked to cite websites where they found information, provide videos, research answers on questions/prompts provided, and have the option of voice recording or video record their opinions with apps like Flipgrid.  After the final draft, students in the students are provided their peers' google slides through links posted on the Google classroom.  Throughout the project, the teacher provided lessons on how information are gathered not only through book but on the internet and how we can pass the information to others.


## Standard: 2-3.NSD.3
###### Describe and attempt troubleshooting steps to solve a simple technology problem.

From the above lesson described above, students are provided with opportunities to encounter technological problems as the project are indepedent research.  Students are asked to go through the problem solving of "3 before me" strategy.  This is a great strategy because there are times students know shortcuts better and can explain differently from a teacher that is easily understood.  During the teacher's lessons, the teacher provides examples on the outcome of the project and show solutions to intentional technology problems that can occur.  One example would be when a picture is inserted and had moved some or all the text in the document to a different location.
