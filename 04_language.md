Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)

Answer the following prompts:

What is the course? 5th grade, consistent exposure to CS and Scratch program

What is the language? Snap

How does one write & run code in this language?  It is very similar to Scratch, block based coding.  Snap is more advanced than Scratch but still not advanced enough to allow users to use block based codes.

Rate the complexity of the syntax?  I would rate it 4 out 5.

Strengths:  It allows students to use prior knowledge on block based programming to advance their coding skills with more coding blocks and freedom to create new blocks

How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?  To start introducing simple programming codes like Java and Python for students to see and become exposed with.

Weaknesses:  As a beginner computer scienter educator who is still learning block base programming, I can't say I can find any weakness at the moment until I teach it to a group of students.  I seem to find more positives than I do in weaknesses at the moment.

How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?  Weaknesses can be altered with how the lessons are delivered, changing the pace or what is introduce might limit weaknesses that can appear.

Why did you select this language for this class?  Due to how well received Scratch is and how quickly students advance in block coding.  It would be advantageous for students to learn and work with an advanced block based programming to be able to expose coding languages.
