I would like to see a drawing coding course geared towards 5th to middle school students using Pencil Code.  Many of my students with disabilities are very creative and hates to write or read.  A program that allows them to display their creativity in a different way can promote their growth in other ways instead of through traditional teaching.  Students can lean coding through blocks or text while creating art.  This can be used in writing as a storyboard/planning, use for projects in various subjects, and art class, all the while learning to code as well.
