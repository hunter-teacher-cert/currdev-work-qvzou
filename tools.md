Classroom Technological tool #1:  
### Jamboard

The purpose of the jamboard is to create a collaborative environment where students can work on digitally.  They are able to write note, add images, create shapes/lines to show their work.  
I have used this tools in various subjects from Reading to Math.  Students use it answer questions, work on problems together, collaborate to show steps in the solution provided or even creating art projects based on the topic provided.
The tool is to provide students to collaborate in a different way, which is interacting digitally without physical materials to use and at times using it to communicate with each other remotely.  This also prompt students to understand the importance of communication and the different type of communication.

Classroom Technological tool #1:  
### Scratch Jr.

The purpose of Scratch Jr. is to introduce students to block programming.  
It uses large blocks and image area (stage) for students to see how the codes work and provide a larger image to clearly see what the code does when it is initiated.  The large images interests students in creating the stage using sprites and working with different images to set up their stage.  
I have used the program for Reading, Writing, and Social Studies.
It allowed my students to display their work in a different way instead of typing an essay on a document or writing/drawing on a paper.  They use Scratch Jr. to develop their writing on a topic or telling a story using different frames to show beginning, middle, end of a story.
