I am a special education elementary teacher in an ICT classroom and do not currently teach computer science directly, but are expected to incorporate computer science concepts in all the academic subjects we teach.

Curriculum: Code.org and CS Matters

Major differences:
Code.org uses java to introduce students to software engineering, object-oriented programming, and design.  CS Matters uses python to provide students the opportunity to learn computer science while focus on data.  CS Matters have a unit that seem to concentrate on a lot of the standards on NYS Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards that is not skill specific, concepts like impact of computing, computational thinking, and networks and system design.  Code.org have a lot of skill based activities and lessons.  CS Matters curriculum mentions the six computational thinking practices and seven big ideas while Code.org provides the CSA standards for each unit.  

Major similarities:
Though CS Matters focus on data more, the concepts of computer science is covered in both CS Matters and Code.org.  They are both organized by units with lessons in each unit.  Both use web based programming language. 

Comparative strengths and weaknesses:
CS Matters is very focus on data but does touch on computer science concepts while Code.org has a variety of concepts and skills being taught.  The curriculum from Code.org is comprehensive and provides many resources and the lessons itself.  

I am not teaching computer science for a specific period, but looking at the resources on Code.org, I would definitely use it.  It ranges to K to college level courses, which is great to see how and what students can learn as they progress.
