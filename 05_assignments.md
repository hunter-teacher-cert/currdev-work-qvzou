# Introduction to AI and Machine Learning

Assignment 1:
Intended audience: 3rd to 6th grade

For this assignment, the students will be introduced to AI and Machine Learning with a video to engage the students.  The 2 minute video will make a connection to us, humans, and how there is a computer who learn to think like human.  The video will provide examples on what uses AI and how machine learns through patterns like our brain does.  The students will discuss the role artifical intelligence plays in their lives.  The students will then use an app provided to complete an activity called Emoji Scavenger Hunt.  In this Emoji Scavenger Hunt, the students will find items in the real world to match with the emoji shown on camera.  While the students hold objects in front of the camera, the AI will ask and try to identify the object held if it does not match with the emoji.  The students would work as group to complete the activity and score as high as possible.  After the activity, the students will turn and discuss with each other what they noticed about the AI and the activity.  

Student instructions:

## What is AI and Machine Learning

With your group complete the following activity:
###### Emoji Scavenger Hunt
1.  Click on the provided link to the activity.  
2.  Click on "Allow" for the app to access the device camera.
3.  The activity will show an emoji and as a group, you will look for items in the classroom that matches with the emoji.  It is timed.
4.  Listen carefully to what the AI is saying and make note on what you noticed about the items the AI "sees."
5.  Try to find as many items as you can and score as high as possible.  Record your scores.

###### Turn and Discuss:
1.  Turn and discuss with your group about the activity after completing the activity.
2.  Discuss about what you noticed about the AI.
3.  Discuss what the AI "sees."
4.  What did you learn about AI during this activity?
5.  What surprised you about the activity/AI?
6.  Write your information down to share out for our KWL chart.



Assignment 2:
Intended Audience: 3rd to 6th grade

In this assignment, students will train and test a machine learning model.  Students will discover how human bias can play a role in machine learning.  The activity can be worked on with a partner or by his/her self.  The students will click on buttons to label an image as either a "fish" or "not fish," usually pictures of a trash.  The students will learn that each image and label will become part of the data the AI collects to train the AI to do it on its own.  After the AI has been trained, the AI will attempt to label new images on its own and show images of what the AI learned are "fish" and "not fish."  When the images are consistently labelled correctly, the AI will be able to display images of "fish" and not other objects.


Student Instructions:

## How do AI learn?

###### Directions:
1. Click on the provided link
2. You will train the AI to understand what images are "fish" and "not fish"
3. Click on the appropriate label matching the images.
4. You will train the AI two times.

###### First AI training instructions:
1.  You will train the AI with the smallest amount of data to see how the AI learns.
2.  There will be a number of images shown above the AI to show how much data it collected.
3.  Provide a small number of images and record the number of images you stopped at.
4.  Write down the result of the AI's training.

###### Second AI training instructions:
1.  You will train the AI with number of images higher than 75 to see how the AI learns.
2.  There will be a number of images shown aboe the AI to show how much data it collected.  Provide a number of images greater than 75 images for the AI to collect.
3.  Write down the number of images you provided the AI to collect.
4.  Write the result of the AI's training.

###### Compare and Contrast
Using the information you have collected, compare and contrast the results.  Discuss/think about the amount of data and even of data collected that can affect the AI's training results.
